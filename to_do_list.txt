remaining tasks:

	x source control? github or other
	* could have more functions inside main draw loop so it is not one giant dump
	* possibly simplify/refactor particle representation.  currently, particles are copied from stl vector to float array 
	* add textures


bugs:
	* starting in portrait mode makes strange behavior
	* little pricklies on tip of volcano
	* figure out better update logic.  currently the frequency of updates can affect the particle heights, etc.  Should have time based updates- not number or frequency of drawframe() calls to determine particle trajectories


high level goals:

	solid, no major bugs
	have textured ground
	have texture mapped volcano with appropriate art
	more visible particles (thicker)
	more particle effects like splitting, rebounding off ground
	full screen?
